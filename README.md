*This app was made purely for practice / educational purposes as well as something to add to my resume*

Things still left to do: 
  1) Re-style mobile & desktop view
  
  2) Convert class based stateful components to functional & use hooks 
  *NOTE* this was purposely not done initially with the intention of going back to convert for more practice :)
    
  3) Add follow functionality
  
  4) Add "like" functionality
